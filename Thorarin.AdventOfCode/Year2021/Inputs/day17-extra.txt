target area: x=352..377, y=-49..-30

Consider the following input:
target area: x=352..377, y=-49..-30

The solution:
66, and not 1176 = 49*48/2

The reason why the simplified calculation does not work:
With the given inputs there is no such initial horizontal velocity which will cause the probe's x coordinate to settle
in the target area - that is, even if there is a step when the x coord matches the target area's x range, a few steps
later the probe will leave that range. This puts a restriction on the y component of the initial velocity as well,
as you have to guarantee that the y and x coords will be in the target area simultaneously.
